# Your Role: Founding Engineer

> *"The best engineers I know treat every project as if it were their own startup."*
> — Anonymous Startup CTO

## What You Are (and What You're Not)

You're not a "DevOps intern." **You're a founding engineer building Autograph.**

## The Founding Engineer vs DevOps vs Platform Engineer

### What Makes a Founding Engineer Different

| Aspect | DevOps | Platform Engineer | Founding Engineer |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Infrastructure | Developer experience | **The product** |
| **Customers** | Development teams | Developers (internal) | **End users** |
| **Measures** | Uptime, deployments | DORA metrics | **User adoption, revenue** |
| **Thinks About** | "Is it deployed?" | "Can devs use it?" | **"Do users love it?"** |
| **Infrastructure Is** | The job | A product | **A means to an end** |

## Your Mindset: Product-First

> *"The best startups seem to start from scratch. The founders just decided what they wanted to build, then built it."*
> — **Paul Graham**, Y Combinator

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Founding<br/>Engineer))
    Product Thinking
      Users are the priority
      Infrastructure serves the product
      Ship features, not just deploys
      Measure what users care about
    Full-Stack Ownership
      Backend to infrastructure
      Database to deployment
      Monitoring to incident response
      Security to scalability
    Startup Mindset
      Move fast
      Learn from failures
      Make decisions with incomplete info
      Ship, measure, iterate
    Technical Excellence
      Clean architecture
      Automation-first
      Security by default
      Observability everywhere
```

## What You Own During This Internship

### The Autograph Stack (All of It)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Product["🚀 THE PRODUCT"]
        Strapi["Strapi CMS"]
        AI["AI Services"]
        Search["Meilisearch"]
    end

    subgraph Data["💾 DATA"]
        PG["PostgreSQL"]
        Redis["Redis"]
    end

    subgraph Platform["⚙️ PLATFORM"]
        K8s["Kubernetes"]
        GitOps["ArgoCD"]
        CI["GitHub Actions"]
    end

    subgraph Infra["🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE"]
        VMs["Hetzner VMs"]
        Network["Private Network"]
        Storage["Block Storage"]
    end

    subgraph Ops["📊 OPERATIONS"]
        Monitoring["Prometheus/Grafana"]
        Logs["Loki"]
        Alerts["AlertManager"]
    end

    Product --> Data --> Platform --> Infra
    Platform --> Ops

    style Product fill:#4CAF50
```

**You own the entire stack.** Not just the infrastructure—the product.

## Daily Responsibilities

### What a Day Looks Like

```mermaid

    subgraph Morning["Morning"]
        M1["Check: Is Autograph healthy?"]
        M2["Review any alerts"]
        M3["Plan today's build work"]
    end

    subgraph Build["Build Time"]
        B1["Work on current week's goals"]
        B2["Deploy, test, iterate"]
        B3["Document as you go"]
    end

    subgraph Review["Review"]

        R2["Push code, create PRs"]
        R3["Update documentation"]
    end

    subgraph Learn["Learn"]
        L1["Research blockers"]
        L2["Read docs for next task"]
        L3["Prepare questions"]
    end

    Morning --> Build --> Review --> Learn
```

### Typical Time Breakdown

| Activity | Time | Examples |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Product check** | 15 min | Is Strapi up? AI services responding? |
| **Deep work: Building** | 4 hours | Infrastructure, deployments, features |
| **Testing & Verification** | 1.5 hours | Does it work? Is it secure? |
| **Documentation** | 1 hour | Update runbooks, architecture docs |
| **Learning & Research** | 1 hour | Read docs, debug blockers |

## The Founder's Checklist

### Before Building Anything

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Have an idea"] --> B{"Does it serve<br/>Autograph users?"}
    B -->|"No"| C["Reconsider priority"]
    B -->|"Yes"| D{"Exists already?"}
    D -->|"Yes"| E["Use/extend existing"]
    D -->|"No"| F{"Documented need?"}
    F -->|"No"| G["Document the problem first"]
    F -->|"Yes"| H["Build it"]

    style B fill:#4CAF50
```

### Building Checklist

- [ ] **Problem documented** — What user problem does this solve?
- [ ] **Alternatives evaluated** — Is there an existing solution?
- [ ] **Design reviewed** — Does this fit Autograph's architecture?
- [ ] **Tests written** — How will I know it works?
- [ ] **Documentation updated** — Can someone else understand this?
- [ ] **Monitoring added** — How will I know if it breaks?
